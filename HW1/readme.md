## week one

This week it was diffcult to get back into the swing of things. I wasn't expecting it to take me as long as it did
to "refresh" my memory after a short four weeks. Remembering the RWD was probably the hardest, not something I have embedded 
concretely into my mind. 
For this assignment I chose to build off of the design I created for my final from last semester. I guess I'm looking to find 
how I want to visually represent myself, or shall I say, my style. It's no easy task for me, it's a concept I 
want to explore more and learn to communicate it authentically.
