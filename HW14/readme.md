This week I tried to just have fun with the assignment but got discouraged when I couldn't figure out how to make the model rotate. I read quite a bit of the three.js website, and checked out many other troubleshooting sources and found how to do alot of other cool things but did not successfully rotate the model after it was added to the scene. Not sure what I'm missing...I did find it useful learning how to make the canvas a background for an entire html page(either using a iframe or setting the z-indexs and positions). Think I'll be working on ideas to incorporate into a site of my own. Also, I tried using url's to import the loaders and controls with no success and i've simply ran out of time, my page works on my safari browser with the local files but not Firefox and Chrome. Overall I really don't feel I was successful with this asignment, I could use another week to figure all this out....
