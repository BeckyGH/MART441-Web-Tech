##Week 2

This week I felt pretty confident in using the console.log(), let's hope I did the homework right. 
I read through chapter one of the Eloquent JavaScript book and I remebered some of what I was reading from 
the creative coding class. However, reading through exactly how and what the language is telling the computer helped me get a more in depth and clear understanding of how and why to use operators with values. Made tons of notes to reference back to.
 I also found the online version of the textbook helpful in that you can interact with it directly with some of the code and the sandbox.
  One of my simple but AH! moments for the hoomework was when I learned the backtick for the strings to create a newline, which I was trying to figure out how to do for a long minute on my homework JS page. It's those little things!
