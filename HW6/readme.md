## week 6

This week was another one of frustration but some things did come easier, like the JSON and using local storage(or at least for this assignment it was easy to apply). I struggled again with getting the game to work and only having the cards show twice but I referred to your example and got it to work. As frustrating as the feeling of not knowing how to put things together to make them work and them not working when I do, I am going to keep studying and practicing. I really want to learn and I think one of my biggest challenges besides the technical side of things is finding a way to keep myself in a mindset of growth, because frustration is a powerful emotion and can hinder things for me. This week I did take the time to find space to clear my head/mind, I used some of my meditation practices to 'reset/balance' things internally, so when I came back to my work I would have a better perspective on it. Now if only I can remind myself to do it consistently when I'm feeling overwhelmed/frustrated...with anything really, not just this course.
