I honestly feel I am way in over my head with nodejs, more so than even the other assignments we've done this semester. I have worked tirelessly to understand what I am suppose to be doing to accomplish the objectives of reading, writing and returning the data. I am simply not comprehending the entirety of the concept of how to send and receieve between the client and server using nodejs. I unfortunately, am turning in the assignment incomplete and not working with alot of commented out code as to show what I did try. It is completely out of my nature to leave things incomplete, and I absolutely don't like the feeling. I know my grade will reflect my inability but I made an appointment to meet with you because I really want to try and find a bit of clarity with this. 

As far as it tying in with the rest of the semester I feel this skill and knowledge does play a crucial part in everything that we have done thus far. I think having a good understanding of the client/server relationship of how things operate will make it possible when designing and creating applications to create a better end user experience, which in most cases is the ultimate goal.
