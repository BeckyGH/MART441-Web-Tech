For this project, I really wanted to learn more about threejs and see if I could build a 3D scene out of shapes and objects. I'm not sure that was the best idea...:) I had a hard time finding a (free)3D model that I liked or seemed to fit with the visual elements that I used. But by experimenting a lot with different mesh shapes and applying textures, I did manage to create the beginnings of a 3D sort of galactic "world" I could expand on. A few technical issue I had was with the morphing lines and implementing shadows. When I added the lines to the scene it started to "glitch", I looked into why this may be and adjusted a few things that got it to smooth out a bit but not exactly to my liking. It seemed after that my focus turned to the colors and positioning for this Lil 'island' I created. The combination of the positioning of the direct light and camera with the use of the rectangle lights made the casting of shadows become a trickier task then I expected. I wasn't willing to give up the rect lights though, I really dig them. However, I would have liked to cast more accurate shadows from the pillars to really add another level of depth. 
 Overall I like this weird little composition I made with my novice threejs skills and I'm pretty sure it's a library I will continue to experiment with.
