This week I was a bit overwhelmed by the reading but I did my best to get through the material. The assignment offered some challenges that I decided to look deeper into. I did some exploring and seeking out ways to display the data and decided with a traditional table. I would have liked to incorporate more 'pazazz', maybe I could have added some more elements or info about the data. Anyhow I think it turned out ok.
