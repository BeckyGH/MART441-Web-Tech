                                <p>My adventure in this life began in Kansas, where I was born and raised.
                                        As a young adult I eventually grew bored of the flatlands and was looking for a new adventure. So, I decided to sell everything I owned
                                        and backpack the United States for awhile. Eventually I landed in Montana and 20 years later am still here.

                                <p>I studied the fine arts in my early 20's and am continuing my education in the Arts. I plan to graduate Spring 2024 with a Bachelor's in Media Arts.

                                <p>as kid I would spend hours drawing, painting, and daydreaming about becoming an artist, it's still 
                                the same today. I have a passion to create, a desire to inspire, and a want to live life to the fulliest.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                I feel a real responsibility to be a good human, take care of our planet and others. Kindness to me is 
                                the ultimate superpower and is my compass point that 
                                shows me the way and brings me back when I get lost.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                When I think about how I see the world I chose to point myself in the direction of the good and the beauty in it all, 
                                not to say I don't see the ulgy or get sidetracked, I just feel that compassion and kindness will help overcome it.
