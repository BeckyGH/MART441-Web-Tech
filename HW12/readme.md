Well this week, again, was a challenge and I spent quite a bit of time breaking things but as alwaya I feel I learn ALOT during the process. After our zoom it took me a bit more time to figure out a way to get the "game" to function with the objectives of the assignment correctly met, but I finally did.(and not my version of making the objects "hide" haha) AND man was that a wonderful feeling when it worked!! :) I really appreciate the help with walking thru the code, during those times I always learn quite a bit and gain more clarity on what to do and not to do.
