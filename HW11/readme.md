## week 11

This week went ok, I was happy to have your help on Friday, I wasn't quite where I needed to be. I did manage to get the objectives of the assignment done but I struggled with the movement of the pink rectangle. I would have liked it to have more movement but was not successful. It's disappointing because I feel like I should know how to do this...and all attempts I made failed; I'll keep working at it though. All in all I think it turned out ok and I did learn alot during my exploration of trying to figure things out.
