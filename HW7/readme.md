This week was a bit easier but still challenging.  I found myself lost in trying to get the images to appear because I didn't have my 
display method returning the correct thing nor the random function written out correctly. I finally got there after I decided to ask for help and you sent me
in the direction I needed to be. I can say that I could use a whole lot more practice with using classes and objects but the concept does make sense. 
This week I again keep reminding myself that it's all about practice, to keep trying and to not forget to ask for help, I am not an island:)
