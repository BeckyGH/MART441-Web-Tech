## week 5

I've began to become a bit discouraged about my abilities....I'm spending ALOT of time on things I feel like I should know how to apply but can't seem to get to work. I do go back through the material, re read and do the exercises but when it comes to using the material i get lost in the translation of what I need to do to make things work. I'm just going to keep trying. but definetly not enjoying this.
